        <h3>A few personal words : </h3>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Akbar Dadgar, I was born in Tabriz on a rainy day
            I have a bachelor's degree in computer software from Bojnord University
            I like programming and coding. I hope this full-stack training course will help me learn
            web design and upload my own website.
            <br />
            <br />
            I read a lot of books and I like the science fiction genre, of course,
            I also like the encyclopedia book, I also like Marvel and DC comics,
            I accept Batman as a perfect superhero, but in general, I agree that Marvel
            could have made a better movie.
            <br />
            <b>Hoping for better days</b>
        </p>
